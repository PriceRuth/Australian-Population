In this project, I focused solely in greater region of Adelaide. There's a huge amount of categories to study but some of them have a lot of missing data.

Insights:

* Female population is much higher than male population in South Australia. It seems like that in 2020, the population is increasing at a slower rate (not massive) in both men and women.

* The highest population rate according to age is between 25 to 39 years old. In 2021, there is a slight decrease in population in ages between 20-24 years old.
